\chapter{Development of a cold atom physics experiment}

Describe how the apparatus was developed over time, what it was designed to do and everything we learned along the way. Include vacuum system design and bakeout, optical setups, atomic transport, etc. Not comprehensive, as I have not played a large role in much of the development of the appratus itself.

\section{Dual species apparatus}
    \subsection{Vacuum chamber and bakeout}
\section{Research visit report}
    Describe setup of TÃ¼bingen experiment (despite lack of results). It's a simple MOT setup, so describing it includes details of optics required for a MOT, which I didn't work on in the Monash apparatus, so this is a good place to describe everything that goes into a MOT experimentally. Include full optics layout I designed.
    \subsection{Optics setup}
    [include layout diagram of setup I designed]
