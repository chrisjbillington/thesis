\chapter{Software for experiment control and analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the problem of controlling experiments of this nature, our proposed solutions, and the implementation thereof in the \emph{labscript suite}. Unix philosophy, sandboxing, lack of requirement of trust in third party software -> fault tolerance. Describe runmananger, BLACS, lyse in detail. Argue benefits of code-based experiments, especially that standard software development industry practices can be very useful to doing science. techniques Draw heavily on paper.
