  abstract = {We describe a method to prepare a sample of superfluid helium-4 with hydrogen particles suspended within it. The method is to dilute hydrogen gas with helium at room temperature, and bubble the mixture through liquid helium at a temperature above the superfluid phase transition temperature, T$\lambda$\&\#xa0;$\approx$\&\#xa0;2.17\&\#xa0;K. The procedure yields a suspension of micron-sized particles whose total volume is about 105 times smaller than the fluid volume. The fluid and suspension are then cooled to a temperature below T$\lambda$. We show that the particles, so prepared in superfluid helium, are useful for studying superfluid flows and, in particular, the dynamics of quantized vortices. In addition, the particle-superfluid helium system is rich in not yet fully explained interactions. We review preliminary investigations that include observing the vortex lattice in rotating helium, vortex reconnection in quantized vortex turbulence, and vortex ring decay. These data illustrate the basic mechanisms of dissipation in superfluid turbulence.},

The precession frequency of a single vortex is measured by explicitly observing its time dependence and is found to be in good agreement with theory. We further characterize the dynamics of vortex dipoles in two distinct configurations: (i) an asymmetric configuration, in which the vortex trajectories are dynamic and nontrivial, and (ii) a stable, symmetric configuration, in which the dipole is stationary.},

This scale is typically below the optical diffraction limit, precluding precise wavefunction engineering using optical potentials alone. We present a protocol to rapidly control the phase and density of a quantum fluid down to the healing length scale using strong time-dependent coupling between internal states of the fluid in a magnetic field gradient. We demonstrate this protocol by simulating the creation of a single stationary soliton and double soliton states in a Bose-Einstein condensate with control over the individual soliton positions and trajectories, using experimentally feasible parameters. Such states are yet to be realized experimentally, and are a path towards engineering soliton gases and exotic topological excitations.},

The FEDVR provides a highly accurate spatial representation using a minimum number of grid points (N) while the RSP algorithm propagates the wave function in O(N) operations per time step. Parallelization of the method is transparent and is implemented here by distributing one or two spatial dimensions across the available processors, within the message-passing-interface scheme. The complete formalism and a number of three-dimensional examples are given; its high accuracy and efficacy are illustrated by a comparison with the usual finite-difference method.},

It contains twenty-two papers by thirty authors. Some of the features are as follows. The first paper gives the foundations of the standard quantum Monte Carlo method, including some recent results on higher-order decompositions of exponential operators and ordered exponentials. The second paper presents a general review of quantum Monte Carlo methods used in the present book. One of the most challenging problems in the field of quantum Monte Carlo techniques, the negative-sign problem, is also discussed and new methods proposed to partially overcome it. In addition, low-dimensional quantum spin systems are studied. Some interesting applications of quantum Monte Carlo methods to fermion systems are also presented to investigate the role of strong correlations and fluctuations of electrons and to clarify the mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity. Not only thermal properties but also quantum-mechanical ground-state properties have been studied by the projection technique using auxiliary fields. Further, the Haldane gap is confirmed by numerical calculations. Active researchers in the forefront of condensed matter physics as well as young graduate students who want to start learning the quantum Monte Carlo methods will find this book useful.},

  abstract = {The rise time of intense radiation determines the maximum field strength atoms can be exposed to before their polarizability dramatically drops due to the detachment of an outer electron. Recent progress in ultrafast optics has allowed the generation of ultraintense light pulses comprising merely a few field oscillation cycles. The arising intensity gradient allows electrons to survive in their bound atomic state up to external field strengths many times higher than the binding Coulomb field and gives rise to ionization rates comparable to the light frequency, resulting in a significant extension of the frontiers of nonlinear optics and (nonrelativistic) high-field physics. Implications include the generation of coherent harmonic radiation up to kiloelectronvolt photon energies and control of the atomic dipole moment on a subfemtosecond (1fs=10-15s) time scale. This review presents the landmarks of the 30-odd-year evolution of ultrashort-pulse laser physics and technology culminating in the generation of intense few-cycle light pulses and discusses the impact of these pulses on high-field physics. Particular emphasis is placed on high-order harmonic emission and single subfemtosecond extreme ultraviolet/x-ray pulse generation. These as well as other strong-field processes are governed directly by the electric-field evolution, and hence their full control requires access to the (absolute) phase of the light carrier. We shall discuss routes to its determination and control, which will, for the first time, allow access to the electromagnetic fields in light waves and control of high-field interactions with never-before-achieved precision.},

  abstract = {We present two cooling mechanisms that lead to temperatures well below the Doppler limit. These mechanisms are based on laser polarization gradients and work at low laser power when the optical-pumping time between different ground-state sublevels becomes long. There is then a large time lag between the internal atomic response and the atomic motion, which leads to a large cooling force. In the simple case of one-dimensional molasses, we identify two types of polarization gradient that occur when the two counterpropagating waves have either orthogonal linear polarizations or orthogonal circular polarizations. In the first case, the light shifts of the ground-state Zeeman sublevels are spatially modulated, and optical pumping among them leads to dipole forces and to a Sisyphus effect analogous to the one that occurs in stimulated molasses. In the second case ($\sigma$+-$\sigma$- configuration), the cooling mechanism is radically different. Even at very low velocity, atomic motion produces a population difference among ground-state sublevels, which gives rise to unbalanced radiation pressures. From semiclassical optical Bloch equations, we derive for the two cases quantitative expressions for friction coefficients and velocity capture ranges. The friction coefficients are shown in both cases to be independent of the laser power, which produces an equilibrium temperature proportional to the laser power. The lowest achievable temperatures then approach the one-photon recoil energy. We briefly outline a full quantum treatment of such a limit.},

Rydberg enabled capabilities include long-range two-qubit gates, collective encoding of multiqubit registers, implementation of robust light-atom quantum interfaces, and the potential for simulating quantum many-body physics.

Furthermore, dipolar interactions between highly excited atoms have been proposed as a mechanism for 'Rydberg blockade', which might provide a novel approach to a number of quantum protocols. Dipolar interactions between Rydberg atoms were observed several decades ago and have been studied recently in a many-body regime using cold atoms. However, to harness Rydberg blockade for controlled quantum dynamics, it is necessary to achieve strong interactions between single pairs of atoms. Here, we demonstrate that a single Rydberg-excited rubidium atom blocks excitation of a second atom located more than 10 m away. The observed probability of double excitation is less than 20\%, consistent with a theoretical model of the Rydberg interaction augmented by Monte Carlo simulations that account for experimental imperfections.},

For one-dimensional (1D) systems, the Luttinger liquid approach provides insight into universal properties. Much is known of the equilibrium state, both in the weakly and strongly interacting regimes. However, it remains a challenge to probe the dynamics by which this equilibrium state is reached. Here we present a direct experimental study of the coherence dynamics in both isolated and coupled degenerate 1D Bose gases. Dynamic splitting is used to create two 1D systems in a phase coherent state. The time evolution of the coherence is revealed through local phase shifts of the subsequently observed interference patterns. Completely isolated 1D Bose gases are observed to exhibit universal sub-exponential coherence decay, in excellent agreement with recent predictions. For two coupled 1D Bose gases, the coherence factor is observed to approach a non-zero equilibrium value, as predicted by a Bogoliubov approach. This coupled-system decay to finite coherence is the matter wave equivalent of phase-locking two lasers by injection. The non-equilibrium dynamics of superfluids has an important role in a wide range of physical systems, such as superconductors, quantum Hall systems, superfluid helium and spin systems. Our experiments studying coherence dynamics show that 1D Bose gases are ideally suited for investigating this class of phenomena.},

He was greatly ahead of his time because, before his ideas could bear fruit, advances in four critical areas were needed: better understanding of the dynamics of the atmosphere; stable computational algorithms to integrate the equations; regular observations of the free atmosphere; and powerful automatic computer equipment.

Quantumturbulence is comprised of quantised vortices that are definite topological defects, giving a prototype of turbulence much simpler than the conventional model. Recent studies have shown clear similarities and differences between quantum and classical turbulence. Following a general introduction of this field, this chapter discusses the energy spectrum at very lowtemperatures. Akey issue is the transfer of energy fromlarge tosmall scales. At scales larger than the mean vortex spacing, the energy spectrum obeys the Kolmogorov law, and the energy is transferred through a Richardson cascade of quantised vortices, which is confirmed by numerical analysis using the vortex filament model and the Gross-Pitaevskii model. This range is considered classical. At scales smaller than the mean vortex spacing, the discreteness of vortices becomes significant, and the energy is transferred by a Kelvin-wave cascade caused by nonlinear interactions between different wavenumber modes of Kelvin-waves excited along a single vortex. This range is considered quantum. The crossover between the quantum and classical regions is discussed.},

Consequently it admits two formal inertial ranges, E(k) $\sim$ $\epsilon$2/3k-5/3$\mkern1mu$and$\mkern1mu$E(k) $\sim$ $\eta$2/3k-3, where $\epsilon$ is the rate of cascade of kinetic energy per unit mass, $\eta$ is the rate of cascade of mean-square vorticity, and the kinetic energy per unit mass is  $\int$ 0$\infty$E(k)$\mkern1mu$dk. The - range is found to entail backward energy cascade, from higher to lower wavenumbers k, together with zero-vorticity flow. The -3 range gives an upward vorticity flow and zero-energy flow. The paradox in these results is resolved by the irreducibly triangular nature of the elementary wavenumber interactions. The formal -3 range gives a nonlocal cascade and consequently must be modified by logarithmic factors. If energy is fed in at a constant rate to a band of wavenumbers $\sim$ki and the Reynolds number is large, it is conjectured that a quasi-steady-state results with a - range for k \guillemotleft{} ki and a -3 range for k \guillemotright{} ki, up to the viscous cutoff. The total kinetic energy increases steadily with time as the - range pushes to ever-lower k, until scales the size of the entire fluid are strongly excited. The rate of energy dissipation by viscosity decreases to zero if kinematic viscosity is decreased to zero with other parameters unchanged.},

  shorttitle = {Turbulence},
  abstract = {Based on a course by the author at the University of Cambridge, this comprehensive text on turbulence and fluid dynamics is aimed at year 4 undergraduates and graduates in applied mathematics, physics and engineering and provides an ideal reference for industry professionals and researchers. It bridges the gap between elementary accounts of turbulence found in undergraduate texts and more rigorous accounts given in monographs on the subject. Containing exercises and many examples, the author combines the maximum of physical insight with the minimum of mathematical detail where possible. The text is highly illustrated throughout, and includes color plates; all required mathematical techniques are covered in extensive appendices. The text is divided into three parts: Part I consists of a traditional introduction to the classical aspects of turbulence, the nature of turbulence, and the equations of fluid mechanics. Mathematics is kept to a minimum, presupposing only an elementary knowledge of fluid mechanics and statistics. Part II tackles the problem of homogeneous turbulence with a focus on numerical methods. Part III covers certain special topics rarely discussed in introductory texts. Many geophysical and astrophysical flows are dominated by the effects of body forces, such as buoyancy, Coriolis and Lorentz forces. Moreover, certain large-scale flows are approximately two-dimensional and this has led to a concerted investigation of two-dimensional turbulence over the last few years. Both the influence of body forces and two-dimensional turbulence are discussed.},

  abstract = {Phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, and can be arranged into universality classes such that systems having unrelated microscopic physics show identical scaling behaviour near the critical point. One prominent universal element of many continuous phase transitions is the spontaneous formation of topological defects during a quench through the critical point1, 2, 3. The microscopic dynamics of defect formation in such transitions are generally difficult to investigate, particularly for superfluids4, 5, 6, 7. However, Bose\textendash{}Einstein condensates (BECs) offer unique experimental and theoretical opportunities for probing these details. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of the BEC phase transition of a trapped atomic gas, in which we observe and statistically characterize the spontaneous formation of vortices during condensation8, 9. Using microscopic theories10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 that incorporate atomic interactions and quantum and thermal fluctuations of a finite-temperature Bose gas, we simulate condensation and observe vortex formation in close quantitative agreement with our experimental results. Our studies provide further understanding of the development of coherence in superfluids, and may allow for direct investigation of universal phase transition dynamics.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen tremendous progress in creating complex atomic many-body quantum systems. One approach is to use macroscopic, effectively thermodynamic ensembles of ultracold atoms to create quantum gases and strongly correlated states of matter, and to analyse the bulk properties of the ensemble. For example, bosonic and fermionic atoms in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice1, 2, 3, 4, 5 can be used for quantum simulations of solid-state models6. The opposite approach is to build up microscopic quantum systems atom-by-atom, with complete control over all degrees of freedom7, 8, 9. The atoms or ions act as qubits and allow the realization of quantum gates, with the goal of creating highly controllable quantum information systems. Until now, the macroscopic and microscopic strategies have been fairly disconnected. Here we present a quantum gas `microscope' that bridges the two approaches, realizing a system in which atoms of a macroscopic ensemble are detected individually and a complete set of degrees of freedom for each of them is determined through preparation and measurement. By implementing a high-resolution optical imaging system, single atoms are detected with near-unity fidelity on individual sites of a Hubbard-regime optical lattice. The lattice itself is generated by projecting a holographic mask through the imaging system. It has an arbitrary geometry, chosen to support both strong tunnel coupling between lattice sites and strong on-site confinement. Our approach can be used to directly detect strongly correlated states of matter; in the context of condensed matter simulation, this corresponds to the detection of individual electrons in the simulated crystal. Also, the quantum gas microscope may enable addressing and read-out of large-scale quantum information systems based on ultracold atoms.},

In particular, it provides a useful research tool for the study of individual atoms, for investigating the details of chemical reactions, and even for the study of atomic motion in the quantum domain.This text begins with a review of the relevant aspects of quantum mechanics; it then turns to the electromagnetic interactions involved in slowing and trapping atoms, in both magnetic and optical traps.

These methods are the use of standard angular momentum coupling formula for state expansion the application of the reduction formula for composite systems; and the application of reduction equations for vector operators from Condon and Shortley. It is shown that all three methods are equivalent, in contrast with previously reported difficulties in obtaining consistency in the phase. Each method is illustrated by calculating the Rabi frequencies for each hyperfine transition in a n 2 S 1/2 -n' 2 q 3/2 manifold. The importance of consistency in the ordering of the quantum numbers in matrix elements of operator components is discussed.},

Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.},

  doi = {10.1098/rspa.1961.0029},
  abstract = {An apparatus is described for detecting single quanta of superfluid circulation round a fine wire in liquid helium II. The wire is stretched down the centre of a cylindrical vessel containing helium, and the circulation may be established by rotating the whole apparatus about the axis of the wire and cooling from above the \$$\backslash$lambda\$-point. The wire can be set into transverse vibration, and the circulation round it can then be obtained from the rate of precession of the plane of vibration. The technique proves to be sufficiently sensitive for the measurement of circulations of order h/m with an accuracy of about 3 \%. The method in its present form measures only an average of the circulation along the length of the wire, and it is found that this average is not quantized. Apparent circulations equal to a fraction of a quantum are attributed to quantized vortices that are attached to only a fraction of the length of the wire, and this interpretation has been confirmed by showing that an apparent circulation of exactly h/m has much greater stability than any other value. In this way the quantization of superfluid circulation in units of h/m has been experimentally verified. Observations made in the course of this work show clearly that superfluid circulations (including free vortex lines) can persist indefinitely even when the rotation of the apparatus is stopped. Values have also been obtained for the circulation round the wire as a function of the angular velocity of rotation, and it is shown from these that the energy of a free vortex line in the helium surrounding the wire may perhaps be considerably smaller than has hitherto been supposed.},

Quantized vorticity has traditionally generated great interest among physicists, but there are now also important engineering applications such as liquid helium cooling of superconducting magnets. Presently much research is done on the relationship between superfluid turbulence and classical turbulence, as intense turbulence can be generated in liquid helium due to its small kinematic viscosity. There is also a close relationship between superfluid behaviour and quantized vorticity in liquid helium and in atomic Bose--Einstein condensates. Putting special emphasis on the interplay between the different disciplines involved, this readable account of recent research will appeal not only to established researchers but also to newcomers and graduate students wishing to enter the field.},

In both cases, the beams often display highly desirable properties such as low divergence, high spectral flux and a simple spatial mode that make them useful in practical applications, as well as the potential to perform measurements at or below the quantum projection noise limit. Both devices display similar second-order correlations that differ from thermal sources.

  abstract = {We present a Monte Carlo wavefunction method for semiclassically modeling spin-\$$\backslash$frac12\$ systems in a magnetic field gradient in one dimension. Our model resolves the conflict of determining what classical force an atom should be subjected to when it is in an arbitrary superposition of internal states. Spatial degrees of freedom are considered to be an environment, entanglement with which decoheres the internal states. Atoms follow classical trajectories through space, punctuated by probabilistic jumps between spin states. We modify the conventional Monte Carlo wavefunction method to jump between states when population transfer occurs, rather than when population is later discarded via exponential decay. This results in a spinor wavefunction that is continuous in time, and allows us to model the classical particle trajectories (evolution of the environment variables) more accurately. The model is not computationally demanding and it agrees well with simulations of the full spatial wavefunction of an atom.},

Fluctuations and dissipation originate in this approach from quantum jumps that occur randomly during the time evolution of the system. This approach can be applied to a wide class of relaxation operators in the Markovian regime, and it is equivalent to the standard master-equation approach. For systems with a number of states N much larger than unity this Monte Carlo wave-function approach can be less expensive in terms of calculation time than the master-equation treatment. Indeed, a wave function involves only N components, whereas a density matrix is described by N2 terms. We evaluate the gain in computing time that may be expected from such a formalism, and we discuss its applicability to several examples, with particular emphasis on a quantum description of laser cooling.},

Topics include: \textbullet{} Foundational problems at the quantum\textendash{}classical border; \textbullet{} The role of the environment and entanglement; \textbullet{} Environment-induced loss of coherence and superselection; \textbullet{} Scattering-induced decoherence and spatial localization; \textbullet{} Master equations; \textbullet{} Decoherence models; \textbullet{} Experimental realization of "Schr{\"o}dinger kittens" and their decoherence; \textbullet{} Quantum computing, quantum error correction, and decoherence-free subspaces; \textbullet{} Implications of decoherence for interpretations of quantum mechanics and for the "measurement problem"; \textbullet{} Decoherence in the brain. Written in a lucid and concise style that is accessible to all readers with a basic knowledge of quantum mechanics, this stimulating book tells the "classical from quantum" story in a comprehensive and coherent manner that brings together the foundational, technical, and experimental aspects of decoherence.

In fact, they arise naturally from considering continuous observation of a damped quantum system. A particularly useful form of quantum trajectories is as linear (but non-unitary) stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equations. In the limit where a strong local oscillator is used in the detection, and where the system is not driven, these quantum trajectories can be solved. This gives an alternative derivation of the probability distributions for completed homodyne and heterodyne detection schemes. It also allows the previously intractable problem of real-time adaptive measurements to be treated. The results for an analytically soluble example of adaptive phase measurements are presented, and future developments discussed.},

The organisation of the article is as follows. After a short summary of the classical description of the decay, a detailed study of the quantum non-decay probability is given. Then the peculiar dynamical situation leading to the formation of an unstable system is identified and the formal and physical aspects of the process are discussed. A detailed analysis is then made of the preparation procedure of an unstable system which is shown to amount to a localisation of the decay fragments within a distance of the order of the range of the forces acting between them. After this the discussion of the general properties of the non-decay probability at all times is completed.},

  abstract = {In the Stern\textendash{}Gerlach effect, a magnetic field gradient splits particles into spatially separated paths according to their spin projection. The idea of exploiting this effect for creating coherent momentum superpositions for matter-wave interferometry appeared shortly after its discovery, almost a century ago, but was judged to be far beyond practical reach. Here we demonstrate a viable version of this idea. Our scheme uses pulsed magnetic field gradients, generated by currents in an atom chip wire, and radio-frequency Rabi transitions between Zeeman sublevels. We transform an atomic Bose\textendash{}Einstein condensate into a superposition of spatially separated propagating wavepackets and observe spatial interference fringes with a measurable phase repeatability. The method is versatile in its range of momentum transfer and the different available splitting geometries. These features make our method a good candidate for supporting a variety of future applications and fundamental studies.},

In both cases, the beams often display highly desirable properties such as low divergence, high spectral flux and a simple spatial mode that make them useful in practical applications, as well as the potential to perform measurements at or below the quantum projection noise limit. Both devices display similar second-order correlations that differ from thermal sources.

In this review the basic tools for coherent atom optics are described including diffraction by nanostructures and laser light, three-grating interferometers, and double wells on atom chips. Scientific advances in a broad range of fields that have resulted from the application of atom interferometers are reviewed. These are grouped in three categories: (i) fundamental quantum science, (ii) precision metrology, and (iii) atomic and molecular physics.

The use of LIAD at short wavelengths allows for fast switching of the desired vapor pressure and permits experiments with long trapping and coherence times. The wavelength dependence of the LIAD effect for both species was explored in a range from 630to253nm in an uncoated quartz cell and a stainless steel chamber. Only a few mW/cm2 of near-UV light produce partial pressures that are high enough to saturate a magneto-optical trap at 3.5\texttimes{}109 87Rb atoms or 7\texttimes{}107 40K atoms. Loading rates as high as 1.2\texttimes{}109 87Rb atoms/s and 8\texttimes{}107 40K atoms/s were achieved without the use of a secondary atom source. After the desorption light is turned off, the pressure quickly decays back to equilibrium with a time constant as short as 200$\mu$s, allowing for long trapping lifetimes after the MOT loading phase.},

BEC is typically created with an exponential evaporation ramp that is optimal for ergodic dynamics with two-body s-wave interactions and no other loss rates, but likely sub-optimal for real experiments. Through repeated machine-controlled scientific experimentation and observations our `learner' discovers an optimal evaporation ramp for BEC production. In contrast to previous work, our learner uses a Gaussian process to develop a statistical model of the relationship between the parameters it controls and the quality of the BEC produced. We demonstrate that the Gaussian process machine learner is able to discover a ramp that produces high quality BECs in 10 times fewer iterations than a previously used online optimization technique. Furthermore, we show the internal model developed can be used to determine which parameters are essential in BEC creation and which are unimportant, providing insight into the optimization process of the system.},

  abstract = {Interacting systems driven far from equilibrium tend to evolve to steady states exhibiting large-scale structure and order. In two-dimensional turbulent flow the seemingly random swirling motion of a fluid can evolve towards persistent large-scale vortices. Lars Onsager proposed a model based on statistical mechanics of quantized vortices to explain such behavior. Here we report the first experimental confirmation of Onsager's model of turbulence. We drag a grid barrier through an oblate superfluid Bose--Einstein condensate to generate non-equilibrium distributions of vortices. We observe an inverse energy cascade driven by the evaporative heating of vortices, leading to steady-state configurations characterized by negative temperatures. Our results open a pathway for quantitative studies of emergent structures in interacting quantum systems driven far from equilibrium.},

Traditionally, atomic gravimeters have used stimulated Raman transitions to separate clouds in momentum space by driving transitions between two internal atomic states. Bragg interferometers utilize only a single internal state, and can therefore be less susceptible to environmental perturbations. Here we show that atoms extracted from a magneto-optical trap using an accelerating optical lattice are a suitable source for a Bragg atom interferometer, allowing efficient beamsplitting and subsequent separation of momentum states for detection. Despite the inherently multi-state nature of atom diffraction, we are able to build a Mach\textendash{}Zehnder interferometer using Bragg scattering which achieves a sensitivity to the gravitational acceleration of $\Delta$ g / g = 2.7 \texttimes{} 10 -9 with an integration time of 1000 s. The device can also be converted to a gravity gradiometer by a simple modification of the light pulse sequence.},

  title = {Negative-{{Temperature Onsager Vortex Clusters}} in a {{Quantum Fluid}}},
  abstract = {Turbulence in classical fluids is a ubiquitous non-equilibrium phenomenon, yet a complete theoretical description for turbulent flow remains a challenging problem. A useful simplification for ideal two-dimensional (2D) fluids is to describe the turbulent flow with long-range-interacting point vortices, each possessing quantised circulation. In 1949, Onsager applied statistical mechanics to determine the equilibria of this model. He showed that at sufficiently high energies, like-circulation vortices preferentially aggregate into large-scale clusters, and are characterised by a negative absolute temperature. Onsager's theory has been highly influential, providing understanding of diverse quasi-2D systems such as turbulent soap films, guiding-centre plasmas, and self-gravitating systems. It also predicts the striking tendency of 2D turbulence to spontaneously form large-scale, long-lived vortices -- Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a well-known example. However, Onsager's theory doesn't quantitatively apply to classical fluids where vorticity is continuous, and experimental systems demonstrating Onsager's point-vortex statistical mechanics have remained elusive. Here we realise high energy, negative-temperature vortex clusters in a uniform superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate. Our results confirm Onsager's prediction of negative temperature clustered phases of quantum vortices, and demonstrate the utility of point-vortex statistical mechanics in 2D quantum fluids. This work opens future directions for the study of turbulent dynamics and we anticipate exploring the entire phase diagram of 2D quantum vortices, including the formation of clusters from 2D quantum turbulence.},

We also give results for the interspecies collisions. We conclude that double condensates of 39K and 41K are possible for purely spin-polarized atoms, and sympathetic cooling between the bosonic 39K and the fermionic 40K will be efficient due to low spin-flip rates and a sizable interspecies scattering length.},
