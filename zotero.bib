This scale is typically below the optical diffraction limit, precluding precise wavefunction engineering using optical potentials alone. We present a protocol to rapidly control the phase and density of a quantum fluid down to the healing length scale using strong time-dependent coupling between internal states of the fluid in a magnetic field gradient. We demonstrate this protocol by simulating the creation of a single stationary soliton and double soliton states in a Bose-Einstein condensate with control over the individual soliton positions and trajectories, using experimentally feasible parameters. Such states are yet to be realized experimentally, and are a path towards engineering soliton gases and exotic topological excitations.},

These include atoms and molecules in time-dependent electromagnetic fields, time-dependent approaches to atomic collision problems, and describing the behavior of materials subjected to internal and external forces. We describe an approach in which the finite-element discrete variable representation (FEDVR) is combined with the real-space product (RSP) algorithm to generate an efficient and highly accurate method for the solution of the time-dependent linear and nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. The FEDVR provides a highly accurate spatial representation using a minimum number of grid points (N) while the RSP algorithm propagates the wave function in O(N) operations per time step. Parallelization of the method is transparent and is implemented here by distributing one or two spatial dimensions across the available processors, within the message-passing-interface scheme. The complete formalism and a number of three-dimensional examples are given; its high accuracy and efficacy are illustrated by a comparison with the usual finite-difference method.},

  abstract = {This book reviews recent developments of quantum Monte Carlo methods and some remarkable applications to interacting quantum spin systems and strongly correlated electron systems. It contains twenty-two papers by thirty authors. Some of the features are as follows. The first paper gives the foundations of the standard quantum Monte Carlo method, including some recent results on higher-order decompositions of exponential operators and ordered exponentials. The second paper presents a general review of quantum Monte Carlo methods used in the present book. One of the most challenging problems in the field of quantum Monte Carlo techniques, the negative-sign problem, is also discussed and new methods proposed to partially overcome it. In addition, low-dimensional quantum spin systems are studied. Some interesting applications of quantum Monte Carlo methods to fermion systems are also presented to investigate the role of strong correlations and fluctuations of electrons and to clarify the mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity. Not only thermal properties but also quantum-mechanical ground-state properties have been studied by the projection technique using auxiliary fields. Further, the Haldane gap is confirmed by numerical calculations. Active researchers in the forefront of condensed matter physics as well as young graduate students who want to start learning the quantum Monte Carlo methods will find this book useful.},

  abstract = {The rise time of intense radiation determines the maximum field strength atoms can be exposed to before their polarizability dramatically drops due to the detachment of an outer electron. Recent progress in ultrafast optics has allowed the generation of ultraintense light pulses comprising merely a few field oscillation cycles. The arising intensity gradient allows electrons to survive in their bound atomic state up to external field strengths many times higher than the binding Coulomb field and gives rise to ionization rates comparable to the light frequency, resulting in a significant extension of the frontiers of nonlinear optics and (nonrelativistic) high-field physics. Implications include the generation of coherent harmonic radiation up to kiloelectronvolt photon energies and control of the atomic dipole moment on a subfemtosecond (1fs=10-15s) time scale. This review presents the landmarks of the 30-odd-year evolution of ultrashort-pulse laser physics and technology culminating in the generation of intense few-cycle light pulses and discusses the impact of these pulses on high-field physics. Particular emphasis is placed on high-order harmonic emission and single subfemtosecond extreme ultraviolet/x-ray pulse generation. These as well as other strong-field processes are governed directly by the electric-field evolution, and hence their full control requires access to the (absolute) phase of the light carrier. We shall discuss routes to its determination and control, which will, for the first time, allow access to the electromagnetic fields in light waves and control of high-field interactions with never-before-achieved precision.},

  abstract = {We present two cooling mechanisms that lead to temperatures well below the Doppler limit. These mechanisms are based on laser polarization gradients and work at low laser power when the optical-pumping time between different ground-state sublevels becomes long. There is then a large time lag between the internal atomic response and the atomic motion, which leads to a large cooling force. In the simple case of one-dimensional molasses, we identify two types of polarization gradient that occur when the two counterpropagating waves have either orthogonal linear polarizations or orthogonal circular polarizations. In the first case, the light shifts of the ground-state Zeeman sublevels are spatially modulated, and optical pumping among them leads to dipole forces and to a Sisyphus effect analogous to the one that occurs in stimulated molasses. In the second case ($\sigma$+-$\sigma$- configuration), the cooling mechanism is radically different. Even at very low velocity, atomic motion produces a population difference among ground-state sublevels, which gives rise to unbalanced radiation pressures. From semiclassical optical Bloch equations, we derive for the two cases quantitative expressions for friction coefficients and velocity capture ranges. The friction coefficients are shown in both cases to be independent of the laser power, which produces an equilibrium temperature proportional to the laser power. The lowest achievable temperatures then approach the one-photon recoil energy. We briefly outline a full quantum treatment of such a limit.},

Furthermore, dipolar interactions between highly excited atoms have been proposed as a mechanism for 'Rydberg blockade', which might provide a novel approach to a number of quantum protocols. Dipolar interactions between Rydberg atoms were observed several decades ago and have been studied recently in a many-body regime using cold atoms. However, to harness Rydberg blockade for controlled quantum dynamics, it is necessary to achieve strong interactions between single pairs of atoms. Here, we demonstrate that a single Rydberg-excited rubidium atom blocks excitation of a second atom located more than 10 m away. The observed probability of double excitation is less than 20\%, consistent with a theoretical model of the Rydberg interaction augmented by Monte Carlo simulations that account for experimental imperfections.},

For one-dimensional (1D) systems, the Luttinger liquid approach provides insight into universal properties. Much is known of the equilibrium state, both in the weakly and strongly interacting regimes. However, it remains a challenge to probe the dynamics by which this equilibrium state is reached. Here we present a direct experimental study of the coherence dynamics in both isolated and coupled degenerate 1D Bose gases. Dynamic splitting is used to create two 1D systems in a phase coherent state. The time evolution of the coherence is revealed through local phase shifts of the subsequently observed interference patterns. Completely isolated 1D Bose gases are observed to exhibit universal sub-exponential coherence decay, in excellent agreement with recent predictions. For two coupled 1D Bose gases, the coherence factor is observed to approach a non-zero equilibrium value, as predicted by a Bogoliubov approach. This coupled-system decay to finite coherence is the matter wave equivalent of phase-locking two lasers by injection. The non-equilibrium dynamics of superfluids has an important role in a wide range of physical systems, such as superconductors, quantum Hall systems, superfluid helium and spin systems. Our experiments studying coherence dynamics show that 1D Bose gases are ideally suited for investigating this class of phenomena.},

In particular, it provides a useful research tool for the study of individual atoms, for investigating the details of chemical reactions, and even for the study of atomic motion in the quantum domain.This text begins with a review of the relevant aspects of quantum mechanics; it then turns to the electromagnetic interactions involved in slowing and trapping atoms, in both magnetic and optical traps. The concluding chapters discuss a broad range of applications, including atomic clocks, studies of ultra-cold collision processes, diffraction and interference of atomic beams, optical lattices, and Bose-Einstein condensation. The book is intended for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students who have some basic knowledge of optics and quantum mechanics.

  abstract = {The Rabi frequency (coupling strength) of an electric-dipole transition is an important experimental parameter in laser-cooling and other atomic physics experiments. Though the relationship between Rabi frequency and atomic wavefunctions and/or atomic lifetimes is discussed in many references, there is a need for a concise, self-contained, accessible introduction to such calculations suitable for use by the typical student of laser cooling (experimental or theoretical). In this paper, I outline calculations of the Rabi frequencies for atoms with sub-structure due to orbital, spin and nuclear angular momentum. I emphasize the physical meaning of the calculations.},

These methods are the use of standard angular momentum coupling formula for state expansion the application of the reduction formula for composite systems; and the application of reduction equations for vector operators from Condon and Shortley. It is shown that all three methods are equivalent, in contrast with previously reported difficulties in obtaining consistency in the phase. Each method is illustrated by calculating the Rabi frequencies for each hyperfine transition in a n 2 S 1/2 -n' 2 q 3/2 manifold. The importance of consistency in the ordering of the quantum numbers in matrix elements of operator components is discussed.},

Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.},

  abstract = {An apparatus is described for detecting single quanta of superfluid circulation round a fine wire in liquid helium II. The wire is stretched down the centre of a cylindrical vessel containing helium, and the circulation may be established by rotating the whole apparatus about the axis of the wire and cooling from above the \$$\backslash$lambda\$-point. The wire can be set into transverse vibration, and the circulation round it can then be obtained from the rate of precession of the plane of vibration. The technique proves to be sufficiently sensitive for the measurement of circulations of order h/m with an accuracy of about 3 \%. The method in its present form measures only an average of the circulation along the length of the wire, and it is found that this average is not quantized. Apparent circulations equal to a fraction of a quantum are attributed to quantized vortices that are attached to only a fraction of the length of the wire, and this interpretation has been confirmed by showing that an apparent circulation of exactly h/m has much greater stability than any other value. In this way the quantization of superfluid circulation in units of h/m has been experimentally verified. Observations made in the course of this work show clearly that superfluid circulations (including free vortex lines) can persist indefinitely even when the rotation of the apparatus is stopped. Values have also been obtained for the circulation round the wire as a function of the angular velocity of rotation, and it is shown from these that the energy of a free vortex line in the helium surrounding the wire may perhaps be considerably smaller than has hitherto been supposed.},

Quantized vorticity has traditionally generated great interest among physicists, but there are now also important engineering applications such as liquid helium cooling of superconducting magnets. Presently much research is done on the relationship between superfluid turbulence and classical turbulence, as intense turbulence can be generated in liquid helium due to its small kinematic viscosity. There is also a close relationship between superfluid behaviour and quantized vorticity in liquid helium and in atomic Bose--Einstein condensates. Putting special emphasis on the interplay between the different disciplines involved, this readable account of recent research will appeal not only to established researchers but also to newcomers and graduate students wishing to enter the field.},

Both devices display similar second-order correlations that differ from thermal sources.

This novel method is an extension of Heller's thawed Gaussian wave-packet dynamics that includes coupling between potential energy surfaces. By studying several standard test problems we demonstrate that the accuracy of the method can be systematically improved while maintaining high efficiency. The method is suitable for investigating the role of quantum coherence in the non-adiabatic dynamics of many-atom molecules.},

  abstract = {We present a Monte Carlo wavefunction method for semiclassically modeling spin-\$$\backslash$frac12\$ systems in a magnetic field gradient in one dimension. Our model resolves the conflict of determining what classical force an atom should be subjected to when it is in an arbitrary superposition of internal states. Spatial degrees of freedom are considered to be an environment, entanglement with which decoheres the internal states. Atoms follow classical trajectories through space, punctuated by probabilistic jumps between spin states. We modify the conventional Monte Carlo wavefunction method to jump between states when population transfer occurs, rather than when population is later discarded via exponential decay. This results in a spinor wavefunction that is continuous in time, and allows us to model the classical particle trajectories (evolution of the environment variables) more accurately. The model is not computationally demanding and it agrees well with simulations of the full spatial wavefunction of an atom.},

  abstract = {We present a wave-function approach to the study of the evolution of a small system when it is coupled to a large reservoir. Fluctuations and dissipation originate in this approach from quantum jumps that occur randomly during the time evolution of the system. This approach can be applied to a wide class of relaxation operators in the Markovian regime, and it is equivalent to the standard master-equation approach. For systems with a number of states N much larger than unity this Monte Carlo wave-function approach can be less expensive in terms of calculation time than the master-equation treatment. Indeed, a wave function involves only N components, whereas a density matrix is described by N2 terms. We evaluate the gain in computing time that may be expected from such a formalism, and we discuss its applicability to several examples, with particular emphasis on a quantum description of laser cooling.},

In fact, they arise naturally from considering continuous observation of a damped quantum system. A particularly useful form of quantum trajectories is as linear (but non-unitary) stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equations. In the limit where a strong local oscillator is used in the detection, and where the system is not driven, these quantum trajectories can be solved. This gives an alternative derivation of the probability distributions for completed homodyne and heterodyne detection schemes. It also allows the previously intractable problem of real-time adaptive measurements to be treated. The results for an analytically soluble example of adaptive phase measurements are presented, and future developments discussed.},

The organisation of the article is as follows. After a short summary of the classical description of the decay, a detailed study of the quantum non-decay probability is given. Then the peculiar dynamical situation leading to the formation of an unstable system is identified and the formal and physical aspects of the process are discussed. A detailed analysis is then made of the preparation procedure of an unstable system which is shown to amount to a localisation of the decay fragments within a distance of the order of the range of the forces acting between them. After this the discussion of the general properties of the non-decay probability at all times is completed.},

  abstract = {In the Stern\textendash{}Gerlach effect, a magnetic field gradient splits particles into spatially separated paths according to their spin projection. The idea of exploiting this effect for creating coherent momentum superpositions for matter-wave interferometry appeared shortly after its discovery, almost a century ago, but was judged to be far beyond practical reach. Here we demonstrate a viable version of this idea. Our scheme uses pulsed magnetic field gradients, generated by currents in an atom chip wire, and radio-frequency Rabi transitions between Zeeman sublevels. We transform an atomic Bose\textendash{}Einstein condensate into a superposition of spatially separated propagating wavepackets and observe spatial interference fringes with a measurable phase repeatability. The method is versatile in its range of momentum transfer and the different available splitting geometries. These features make our method a good candidate for supporting a variety of future applications and fundamental studies.},

In both cases, the beams often display highly desirable properties such as low divergence, high spectral flux and a simple spatial mode that make them useful in practical applications, as well as the potential to perform measurements at or below the quantum projection noise limit. Both devices display similar second-order correlations that differ from thermal sources.

Scientific advances in a broad range of fields that have resulted from the application of atom interferometers are reviewed. These are grouped in three categories: (i) fundamental quantum science, (ii) precision metrology, and (iii) atomic and molecular physics.

The use of LIAD at short wavelengths allows for fast switching of the desired vapor pressure and permits experiments with long trapping and coherence times. The wavelength dependence of the LIAD effect for both species was explored in a range from 630to253nm in an uncoated quartz cell and a stainless steel chamber. Only a few mW/cm2 of near-UV light produce partial pressures that are high enough to saturate a magneto-optical trap at 3.5\texttimes{}109 87Rb atoms or 7\texttimes{}107 40K atoms. Loading rates as high as 1.2\texttimes{}109 87Rb atoms/s and 8\texttimes{}107 40K atoms/s were achieved without the use of a secondary atom source. After the desorption light is turned off, the pressure quickly decays back to equilibrium with a time constant as short as 200$\mu$s, allowing for long trapping lifetimes after the MOT loading phase.},

BEC is typically created with an exponential evaporation ramp that is optimal for ergodic dynamics with two-body s-wave interactions and no other loss rates, but likely sub-optimal for real experiments. Through repeated machine-controlled scientific experimentation and observations our `learner' discovers an optimal evaporation ramp for BEC production. In contrast to previous work, our learner uses a Gaussian process to develop a statistical model of the relationship between the parameters it controls and the quality of the BEC produced. We demonstrate that the Gaussian process machine learner is able to discover a ramp that produces high quality BECs in 10 times fewer iterations than a previously used online optimization technique. Furthermore, we show the internal model developed can be used to determine which parameters are essential in BEC creation and which are unimportant, providing insight into the optimization process of the system.},
