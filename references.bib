The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 x 1012 per cubic centimeter and could be preserved for more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of {Bose-Einstein} condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.},

Quantized vorticity has traditionally generated great interest among physicists, but there are now also important engineering applications such as liquid helium cooling of superconducting magnets. Presently much research is done on the relationship between superfluid turbulence and classical turbulence, as intense turbulence can be generated in liquid helium due to its small kinematic viscosity. There is also a close relationship between superfluid behaviour and quantized vorticity in liquid helium and in atomic {Bose--Einstein} condensates. Putting special emphasis on the interplay between the different disciplines involved, this readable account of recent research will appeal not only to established researchers but also to newcomers and graduate students wishing to enter the field.},

Through optical pumping, the atom can be made to fell decelerating optical dipole forces more strongly than accelerating optical dipole forces. This effect, which has previously been realized for free atoms, is called Sisyphus cooling. A simple model for a bound atom is examined in order to reveal the basic aspects of cooling and heating when the atom is confined in the {Lamb{\textendash}Dicke} regime. Results of semiclassical and quantum treatments show that the minimum energy achieved is near the zero-point energy and can be much lower than the Doppler cooling limit. Two practical examples that approximate the model are briefly examined.},

  abstract = {Phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, and can be arranged into universality classes such that systems having unrelated microscopic physics show identical scaling behaviour near the critical point. One prominent universal element of many continuous phase transitions is the spontaneous formation of topological defects during a quench through the critical point1, 2, 3. The microscopic dynamics of defect formation in such transitions are generally difficult to investigate, particularly for superfluids4, 5, 6, 7. However, {Bose{\textendash}Einstein} condensates {(BECs)} offer unique experimental and theoretical opportunities for probing these details. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of the {BEC} phase transition of a trapped atomic gas, in which we observe and statistically characterize the spontaneous formation of vortices during condensation8, 9. Using microscopic theories10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 that incorporate atomic interactions and quantum and thermal fluctuations of a finite-temperature Bose gas, we simulate condensation and observe vortex formation in close quantitative agreement with our experimental results. Our studies provide further understanding of the development of coherence in superfluids, and may allow for direct investigation of universal phase transition dynamics.},

In particular, it provides a useful research tool for the study of individual atoms, for investigating the details of chemical reactions, and even for the study of atomic motion in the quantum {domain.This} text begins with a review of the relevant aspects of quantum mechanics; it then turns to the electromagnetic interactions involved in slowing and trapping atoms, in both magnetic and optical traps. The concluding chapters discuss a broad range of applications, including atomic clocks, studies of ultra-cold collision processes, diffraction and interference of atomic beams, optical lattices, and {Bose-Einstein} condensation. The book is intended for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students who have some basic knowledge of optics and quantum mechanics.

  abstract = {An apparatus is described for detecting single quanta of superfluid circulation round a fine wire in liquid helium {II.} The wire is stretched down the centre of a cylindrical vessel containing helium, and the circulation may be established by rotating the whole apparatus about the axis of the wire and cooling from above the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-point. The wire can be set into transverse vibration, and the circulation round it can then be obtained from the rate of precession of the plane of vibration. The technique proves to be sufficiently sensitive for the measurement of circulations of order h/m with an accuracy of about 3 \%. The method in its present form measures only an average of the circulation along the length of the wire, and it is found that this average is not quantized. Apparent circulations equal to a fraction of a quantum are attributed to quantized vortices that are attached to only a fraction of the length of the wire, and this interpretation has been confirmed by showing that an apparent circulation of exactly h/m has much greater stability than any other value. In this way the quantization of superfluid circulation in units of h/m has been experimentally verified. Observations made in the course of this work show clearly that superfluid circulations (including free vortex lines) can persist indefinitely even when the rotation of the apparatus is stopped. Values have also been obtained for the circulation round the wire as a function of the angular velocity of rotation, and it is shown from these that the energy of a free vortex line in the helium surrounding the wire may perhaps be considerably smaller than has hitherto been supposed.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen tremendous progress in creating complex atomic many-body quantum systems. One approach is to use macroscopic, effectively thermodynamic ensembles of ultracold atoms to create quantum gases and strongly correlated states of matter, and to analyse the bulk properties of the ensemble. For example, bosonic and fermionic atoms in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice1, 2, 3, 4, 5 can be used for quantum simulations of solid-state models6. The opposite approach is to build up microscopic quantum systems atom-by-atom, with complete control over all degrees of freedom7, 8, 9. The atoms or ions act as qubits and allow the realization of quantum gates, with the goal of creating highly controllable quantum information systems. Until now, the macroscopic and microscopic strategies have been fairly disconnected. Here we present a quantum gas {\textquoteleft}microscope{\textquoteright} that bridges the two approaches, realizing a system in which atoms of a macroscopic ensemble are detected individually and a complete set of degrees of freedom for each of them is determined through preparation and measurement. By implementing a high-resolution optical imaging system, single atoms are detected with near-unity fidelity on individual sites of a Hubbard-regime optical lattice. The lattice itself is generated by projecting a holographic mask through the imaging system. It has an arbitrary geometry, chosen to support both strong tunnel coupling between lattice sites and strong on-site confinement. Our approach can be used to directly detect strongly correlated states of matter; in the context of condensed matter simulation, this corresponds to the detection of individual electrons in the simulated crystal. Also, the quantum gas microscope may enable addressing and read-out of large-scale quantum information systems based on ultracold atoms.},

The precession frequency of a single vortex is measured by explicitly observing its time dependence and is found to be in good agreement with theory.

  abstract = {We present two cooling mechanisms that lead to temperatures well below the Doppler limit. These mechanisms are based on laser polarization gradients and work at low laser power when the optical-pumping time between different ground-state sublevels becomes long. There is then a large time lag between the internal atomic response and the atomic motion, which leads to a large cooling force. In the simple case of one-dimensional molasses, we identify two types of polarization gradient that occur when the two counterpropagating waves have either orthogonal linear polarizations or orthogonal circular polarizations. In the first case, the light shifts of the ground-state Zeeman sublevels are spatially modulated, and optical pumping among them leads to dipole forces and to a Sisyphus effect analogous to the one that occurs in stimulated molasses. In the second case (?+-?- configuration), the cooling mechanism is radically different. Even at very low velocity, atomic motion produces a population difference among ground-state sublevels, which gives rise to unbalanced radiation pressures. From semiclassical optical Bloch equations, we derive for the two cases quantitative expressions for friction coefficients and velocity capture ranges. The friction coefficients are shown in both cases to be independent of the laser power, which produces an equilibrium temperature proportional to the laser power. The lowest achievable temperatures then approach the one-photon recoil energy. We briefly outline a full quantum treatment of such a limit.},

  abstract = {Based on a course by the author at the University of Cambridge, this comprehensive text on turbulence and fluid dynamics is aimed at year 4 undergraduates and graduates in applied mathematics, physics and engineering and provides an ideal reference for industry professionals and researchers. It bridges the gap between elementary accounts of turbulence found in undergraduate texts and more rigorous accounts given in monographs on the subject. Containing exercises and many examples, the author combines the maximum of physical insight with the minimum of mathematical detail where possible. The text is highly illustrated throughout, and includes color plates; all required mathematical techniques are covered in extensive appendices. The text is divided into three parts: Part I consists of a traditional introduction to the classical aspects of turbulence, the nature of turbulence, and the equations of fluid mechanics. Mathematics is kept to a minimum, presupposing only an elementary knowledge of fluid mechanics and statistics. Part {II} tackles the problem of homogeneous turbulence with a focus on numerical methods. Part {III} covers certain special topics rarely discussed in introductory texts. Many geophysical and astrophysical flows are dominated by the effects of body forces, such as buoyancy, Coriolis and Lorentz forces. Moreover, certain large-scale flows are approximately two-dimensional and this has led to a concerted investigation of two-dimensional turbulence over the last few years. Both the influence of body forces and two-dimensional turbulence are discussed.},

The first edition of this book, published in 1922, set out a detailed algorithm for systematic numerical weather prediction. The method of computing atmospheric changes, which he mapped out in great detail in this book, is essentially the method used today. He was greatly ahead of his time because, before his ideas could bear fruit, advances in four critical areas were needed: better understanding of the dynamics of the atmosphere; stable computational algorithms to integrate the equations; regular observations of the free atmosphere; and powerful automatic computer equipment. Over the ensuing years, progress in numerical weather prediction has been dramatic. Weather prediction and climate modelling have now reached a high level of sophistication, and are witness to the influence of Richardson's ideas. This edition contains a new foreword by Peter Lynch that sets the original book in context.},

Quantumturbulence is comprised of quantised vortices that are definite topological defects, giving a prototype of turbulence much simpler than the conventional model. Recent studies have shown clear similarities and differences between quantum and classical turbulence. Following a general introduction of this field, this chapter discusses the energy spectrum at very lowtemperatures. Akey issue is the transfer of energy fromlarge tosmall scales. At scales larger than the mean vortex spacing, the energy spectrum obeys the Kolmogorov law, and the energy is transferred through a Richardson cascade of quantised vortices, which is confirmed by numerical analysis using the vortex filament model and the {Gross-Pitaevskii} model. This range is considered classical. At scales smaller than the mean vortex spacing, the discreteness of vortices becomes significant, and the energy is transferred by a Kelvin-wave cascade caused by nonlinear interactions between different wavenumber modes of Kelvin-waves excited along a single vortex. This range is considered quantum. The crossover between the quantum and classical regions is discussed.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional turbulence has both kinetic energy and mean-square vorticity as inviscid constants of motion. Consequently it admits two formal inertial ranges, E(k) \~{} ?2/3k-5/3?and?E(k) \~{} ?2/3k-3, where ? is the rate of cascade of kinetic energy per unit mass, ? is the rate of cascade of mean-square vorticity, and the kinetic energy per unit mass is  ? {0$\infty$E(k)}?dk. The - range is found to entail backward energy cascade, from higher to lower wavenumbers k, together with zero-vorticity flow. The -3 range gives an upward vorticity flow and zero-energy flow. The paradox in these results is resolved by the irreducibly triangular nature of the elementary wavenumber interactions. The formal -3 range gives a nonlocal cascade and consequently must be modified by logarithmic factors. If energy is fed in at a constant rate to a band of wavenumbers \~{}ki and the Reynolds number is large, it is conjectured that a quasi-steady-state results with a - range for k {\guillemotleft} ki and a -3 range for k {\guillemotright} ki, up to the viscous cutoff. The total kinetic energy increases steadily with time as the - range pushes to ever-lower k, until scales the size of the entire fluid are strongly excited. The rate of energy dissipation by viscosity decreases to zero if kinematic viscosity is decreased to zero with other parameters unchanged.},

A simple bus architecture facilitates creating new and specialized devices with only moderate experience in circuit design. Each device operates independently, requiring only an Ethernet network connection to the controlling computer, a clock signal, and a trigger signal. This makes the system highly robust and scalable. The devices can all be connected to a single external clock, allowing synchronous operation of a large number of devices for situations requiring precise timing of many parallel control and acquisition channels. Provided an accurate enough clock, these devices are capable of triggering events separated by one day with near-microsecond precision.

  abstract = {Interference with atomic and molecular matter waves is a rich branch of atomic physics and quantum optics. It started with atom diffraction from crystal surfaces and the separated oscillatory fields technique used in atomic clocks. Atom interferometry is now reaching maturity as a powerful art with many applications in modern science. In this review the basic tools for coherent atom optics are described including diffraction by nanostructures and laser light, three-grating interferometers, and double wells on atom chips. Scientific advances in a broad range of fields that have resulted from the application of atom interferometers are reviewed. These are grouped in three categories: (i) fundamental quantum science, (ii) precision metrology, and (iii) atomic and molecular physics. Although some experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates are included, the focus of the review is on linear matter wave optics, i.e., phenomena where each single atom interferes with itself.},

This magnetometer attains a field sensitivity of 8.3 {pT/Hz1/2} over a measurement area of 120 $\mu$m2, an improvement over the low-frequency field sensitivity of modern {SQUID} magnetometers. The achieved phase sensitivity is close to the atom shot-noise limit, estimated as 0.15 {pT/Hz1/2} for a unity duty cycle measurement, suggesting the possibilities of spatially resolved spin-squeezed magnetometry. This magnetometer marks a significant application of degenerate atomic gases to metrology.},

First, we analyze the best suited degrees of freedom of these particles for storing quantum information, and then we discuss both single- and two-qubit gate implementations. We focus our discussion mainly on collisional quantum gates, which are best suited for atom-chip-like devices, as well as on gate proposals conceived for optical lattices. Additionally, we analyze schemes both for cold atoms confined in optical cavities and hybrid approaches to entanglement generation, and we show how optimal control theory might be a powerful tool to enhance the speed up of the gate operations as well as to achieve high fidelities required for fault tolerant quantum computation.},

Today it is understood that the answer is yes, and many research groups around the world are working towards the highly ambitious technological goal of building a quantum computer, which would dramatically improve computational power for particular tasks. A number of physical systems, spanning much of modern physics, are being developed for quantum computation. However, it remains unclear which technology, if any, will ultimately prove successful.

Connecting computers is so difficult that software and services to do this is a multi-billion dollar business. So today we're still connecting applications using raw {UDP} and {TCP}, proprietary protocols, {HTTP}, Websockets. It remains painful, slow, hard to scale, and essentially centralized. To fix the world, we needed to do two things. One, to solve the general problem of "how to connect any code to any code, anywhere". Two, to wrap that up in the simplest possible building blocks that people could understand and use easily. It sounds ridiculously simple. And maybe it is. That's kind of the whole {point."If} you are a programmer and you aim to build large systems, in any language, then Code Connected is essential reading. Code Connected Volume 1 takes you through learning {ZeroMQ}, step-by-step, with over 80 examples.

Furthermore, each algorithm is formulated in a high-level notation as an instance of the general, unifying basic algorithm, and the fundamental theoretical results on the algorithms are presented. Finally, after presenting experimental results for three test functions representing a unimodal and a multimodal case as well as a step function with discontinuities, similarities and differences of the algorithms are elaborated, and some hints to open research questions are sketched.},
