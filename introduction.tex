\chapter{Introduction}

[summarise forthcoming chapters, specifically pointing out which sections are new results and which are not, and which results are numerics/theory and which are experiment]

\begin{itemize}
\item Brief historical overview of the discovery of Boseâ€“Einstein condensation, laser cooling, turbulence and superfluids and vorticity.

\item Discuss how rich the field currently is with applications to precision measurement, quantum information and quantum simulation. Advances are being made in theory, experiment and numerics, in particular with new technology and techniques allowing the latter two to become much more powerful than in the past.
\end{itemize}
