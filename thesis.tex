% \section*{Todo list}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item short caption for all figures for figure list and same for table list.
%     \item Read through looking for using hyphenation in adjectives and not otherwise.
%     \item section -> Section
%     \item acknowledgements
%     \item consistent quote marks
%     \item list of abbreviations
%     \item for upright exponential e's
%     \item check for upright imaginary i's
%     \item check for square bracketed todos
%     \item spellcheck whole thing
%     \item confim < 80k words
%     \item put the old what's new bits in the separate chapters
%     \item add to numerics intro mention of the fact that I use these methods in other sections. "review" "Appraisal" "quantitative comparison of benefits" "detailed quantitative appraisal" - most people's numerics sections are sparse - unexamined choice of methods. Defined target audience - new PhD students. Cite Tannor in the intro.  "rapid approach to understanding" for atomic physicists specifically. "Operational"
% Quote numerical recipes on the virtues of simplicity - arm long section of shelf in library got their numerics wrong
%     \item langle rangle fix replace with bras and kets.
%     \item 3D, 2D, \textsc{2d} etc.

% \end{itemize}

% software additions:
% add figures from transfer report and from rottnest talk.
% add experiment script from transfer report - port it to new labscript.
% change titles to be the same as transfer report?
