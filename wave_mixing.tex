\chapter{Wave mixing in Boseâ€“Einstein condensates}

    \section{Off-resonant four wave mixing}
    Describe the wave mixing experiments and their results, compare with the simulations I performed and provide the simplified three-level model explaining the results.

    \section{Spin wave mixing}
    Show results of spin wave mixing simulations, including scaling behaviour with increasing c2.
