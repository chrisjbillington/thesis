Sch\"rodinger - ensure umlauts everywhere

Check all references to bases have {} brackets around them: "the basis {|n>}"

Check Dirac deltas all upright

Check timestep deltas all upright

What's a zero energy resonance?

Wavefunctions must be continuous and smooth. First derivatives must be equal
at an interface. This is one way of reasoning as to why you get reflections
when the potential changes suddenly.

Ensure footnote markers are after punctuation
Ensure all integrals have a "\," before the "\dd"

Ensure all units are done with appropriate macro
Ensure all exponents are done with appropriate macro
Ensure all cross-references are done with appropriate macros
Ensure no duplicate bibliography items
Ensure all small caps are done using a macro?
Ensure all bras and kets are done with macros
Ensure all derivatives are done with macros
Ensure all texttt done with macros
Ensure delta t's are all before Hamiltonians in exponents
Ensure citation and credit is given to others for control system chapter, as it is adapted from the paper

Ensure all unitaries are of the form U(t_f, t_i)
Ensure all ordered products are written with descending indices and no time-ordering meta-operator

Be sure to comment in rk4ilip section on split-step methods being able to use arbitrary *linear*
operators if you really want them to, as per split-operator section
Make sure all unitaries have hats
