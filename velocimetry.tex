\chapter{Particle velocimetry of vortices in Boseâ€“Einstein condensates}

    \section{Semiclassical simulations}
    Provide details of how the simulations were performed and the results they gave. Describe method of computing collisions between the classically modelled particles and the condensate, and how the fluorescence imaging was simulated. Present results and discuss experimental feasibility.

    \section{Sisyphus cooling in a magnetic field}
    Describe the scheme for Sisyphus cooling I developed, and show 1D simulation results.
