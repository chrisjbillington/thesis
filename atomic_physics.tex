\chapter{Atomic physics: Experimental techniques and theory}

Descriptions of the relevant physics in atomic physics experiments: Doppler cooling and magneto-optical traps, Sisyphus cooling, dipole forces, Feshbach resonances, scattering theory, Bose–Einstein statistics. Show how the Hamiltonian of a `two level' (32 levels, all things considered for $^{87}$Rb D line) atom with fine structure, hyperfine structure and Zeeman splitting arises from consideration of the different angular momenta. Use this to derive the differential equations for the state populations of an atom in a driving laser field. Gross Pitaevskii equation for single species, dual species and spinor condensate.
