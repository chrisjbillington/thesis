\chapter*{Abstract}

Studies in cold quantum gases enjoy a tight coupling between theory and experiment. Bose--Einstein condensates are well modelled by mean-field theory, with which one may efficiently simulate a large number of Bose-condensed atoms. The efficacy and tractability of this and other approximate models make them powerful tools for guiding experiments in cold quantum gases for precision measurement, quantum computation, quantum simulation, and studies of superfluid turbulence.

Whilst mean-field theory well describes the motional state of atoms in a Bose--Einstein condensate, their internal states---the motion of their electrons relative to the nucleus---are instead described by the Schr\"odinger equation. With this equation---reduced to a small discrete basis for only the relevant electronic states of a given problem---modelling the internal state of an atom is also tractable. Above the critical temperature required for condensation, atoms are not condensed, and move through space more like classical billiard balls---no longer described by mean-field theory. If the atoms' residual wavelike behaviour can be ignored---as it often can---their motion can be modelled using classical mechanics even though their internal state is modelled quantum-mechanically. This approach, called a `semiclassical' model, has been used with great success for theoretical studies of laser cooling, and has been used by Christopher Watkins in the Monash Quantum Fluids group in simulations of evaporative cooling in magnetic traps.

However, the fundamental disconnect between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics prevents na\"ive semiclassical models from reproducing one of the bedrock experiments of quantum mechanics---the Stern--Gerlach experiment. In this experiment, the force on atoms depends on their internal state, such that atoms are measured to have probabilistically taken any of a number of trajectories. These trajectories are still individually classical, but cannot be reproduced collectively within the framework of deterministic classical motion. This problem led to an unphysical heating of the atom cloud in the aforementioned simulations of evaporative cooling, due to the sensitivity of Majorana losses on the details of Stern--Gerlach separation of atoms near the magnetic field zero of the trap.

In this thesis I develop a method called the \emph{hidden-variable semiclassical method} to resolve this disconnect and allow semiclassical models to include state-dependent forces. The method makes use of \emph{hidden variables}---labels or other variables carried alongside quantum states that declare in some sense what state the system is `really' in, despite the quantum description of the state being a superposition. These labels evolve according to rules that ensure the probability of a particular state being selected out is equal to its probability as given by the quantum state. Hidden-variable theories were developed as fundamental theories of physics in order to resolve philosophical objections to quantum mechanics, but they invite objections of their own. Nonetheless, their ability to wrap a layer of classical interpretation around a quantum state serves as exactly the tool we need to reconcile the quantum and classical parts of a semiclassical model.

During preparation of this thesis I discovered that this core idea mirrors that of the surface-hopping method used in quantum chemistry. In this thesis I make the connection between these methods and hidden variables, and present unique aspects of my implementation. I solve a problem that in existing surface-hopping methods leads to unphysically large decoherence rates for large wavepackets---and hence low temperatures. This improves the applicability of these methods to cold atom physics.

State-dependent forces are central to cooling, trapping, and manipulating cold atoms. In this thesis I present a numerical investigation of a new imaging method for observing the motion of vortices in a Bose--Einstein condensate, based on a consideration of inter-atomic forces and how they vary for different species of atom. In this method, the inter-species force between rubidium and potassium atoms is exploited such that atoms of one species become trapped in the vortex cores of a turbulent Bose--Einstein condensate comprised of the other. Imaging of the trapped `tracer' atoms then reveals the motion of the vortices. To see vortex motion over time necessitates cooling to keep the tracer atoms trapped in vortex cores. I investigate both sympathetic cooling from the condensate, and present a new laser cooling scheme, capable of sub-Doppler cooling in a $34\unit{G}$ magnetic field, the field strength at which a Feshbach resonance can be used to enhance the inter-species force. This cooling scheme---which I model semiclassically---relies crucially on state-dependent optical forces for the Sisyphean effect that removes kinetic energy from atoms. I also discuss another proposed cooling scheme with state-dependent forces that are difficult to model semiclassically, one of the motivations for developing the hidden-variable semiclassical method.

The prevalence of time-dependent simulations in cold atom physics has led to the adoption of a range of powerful numerical methods for modelling cold atom systems. In this thesis I give a pedagogical introduction and detailed quantitative appraisal of a number of these methods, and I present a modification of the $4^\up{th}$ order Runge--Kutta scheme for timestepping differential equations that allows for larger timesteps for certain problems.

A cold atom physics experiment necessitates capable software for controlling the precise timing of the relevant control fields and measurement devices required for doing quantum science. In this thesis I present the \emph{labscript suite}, a powerful control and analysis system for hardware-timed experiments. This open-source software project leverages design and development principles from the field of software engineering to produce a system that allows users to compose experiments as human-readable Python code, allowing for modularity, revision control and re-use. A graphical program automates the construction of complex parameter spaces over which an experiment is to be run, and user-provided analysis routines are run on the data immediately after acquisition to produce live-updating plots. The project is developed by a small but growing community, accepts changes and takes direction from any interested parties to meet the needs of a range of experiments, and has been adopted by a dozen or so groups at leading institutions around the world.
