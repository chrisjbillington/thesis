\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

% Over the past few years during my PhD, I've been able to learn fascinating things from interesting people, play with fun technological toys, and contribute meaningfully to scientific progress. I could not have done any of this without the support, friendship, and mentorship of many people. The Science Advanced cohort w Lincoln Turner brought me up to speed on a wide range of topics
